# 8-Puzzle Solver

Yeay, another 8-puzzle solver! _Who needs this, though?_ Well, this is just my attempt to solve 8-puzzle using A\* algorithm. Previously, I did not know that A\* algorithm can be used for this, but I was recommended a few videos in YouTube about using A\* search to solve 8-puzzle. I thought "Hmm, that's interesting." And so this is my attempt.
